BROWNIAN MOTION

lab1. Using the algorithm "Simulation of the trajectory of the Brownian motion" simulate a path of the Wiener process. 
Number of end-points of the grid including T is N = 100, length of the 
interval [0, T ] in time units is 1, time increment is ∆ = T/N. Plot the 
path.
lab2. Using the algorithm "Brownian motion as the limit of a random walk" simulate three paths of the Wiener 
process as the limit of a random walk (n = 10, 100, 1000). Plot the paths 
in one figure, add legends.
lab3. Using the the Karhunen-Loeve expansion simulate three 
paths of the Wiener process with n = 10, 50, 100 terms. Plot the paths in 
one figure, add legends.
lab4. Plot a trajectory of the geometric Brownian motion ob- 
tained from the simulation of the path of the Wiener process, σ = 0.5 
(volatility), and r = 1 (interest rate).
lab5. Plot a trajectory of the the Brownian bridge starting at x 
at time 0 and terminating its run at y = −1 at time T obtained from the 
simulation of the path of the Wiener process.
